# Changelog

## 1.1.0 - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Cursor edition** - full self-contained `.cursor/` mirror so Cursor users get the accelerator without enabling the opt-in "read `.claude`" setting: 30 skills (`.cursor/skills/`), 28 agents (`.cursor/agents/`), 27 commands converted to Cursor `name`/`description` frontmatter (`.cursor/commands/`), `hooks.json` + scripts with events translated to Cursor's model (`sessionStart`, `beforeShellExecution`, `afterFileEdit`), three always-on/PHP-scoped rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), DOD/principles/stabilization docs, and a README documenting the double-loading caveat.
- **Codex edition** - Codex-idiomatic layout: 30 skills in `.agents/skills/` (the path Codex discovers), plus `.codex/` holding `config.toml` (enables hooks, MCP placeholder), `hooks.json` + scripts using Codex's Claude-compatible event schema (`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`), DOD/principles/stabilization docs, and READMEs (`.codex/README.md`, `.agents/README.md`) explaining Codex's model (custom prompts deprecated -> skills; trust requirement).
- **Best-practice depth across skills** - compact, high-signal sections added to:
  - `coder`: modern PHP 8.x idioms, typed exception hierarchy/error handling, PSR-3 logging, configuration, PSR-15 middleware.
  - `test-generator`: AAA, test-double taxonomy, data providers, determinism, coverage targets, mutation testing.
  - `api-designer`: versioning & deprecation, idempotency keys, content negotiation, cursor vs offset pagination.
  - `database-designer`: transaction isolation/deadlocks/locking, expand-contract zero-downtime migrations, soft delete/auditing, correct data types.
  - `architect`: when-not-to-add-a-layer (YAGNI), ports & adapters, concurrency/idempotency, failure/resilience.
  - `code-reviewer`: review-conduct practices (severity labels, actionable feedback, scope).
  - `security-reviewer`: tooling support (`composer audit`, Psalm/PHPStan taint analysis, dangerous-sink grep, secure defaults).
  - `refactorer`: code-smell -> refactoring catalog and the strangler-fig pattern.
  - `writing-plans`: plan-quality practices (safe sequencing, incremental delivery, reversibility).
  - `frontend-design` / `coder-frontend`: frontend best practices and context-aware output escaping + asset hygiene.
  - `documentation-generator`: docs-with-code, runnable examples, Keep a Changelog + SemVer.
  - `using-git-worktrees`: branch and commit hygiene.

### Changed

- **Disambiguated overlapping skills/agents** with explicit "Scope Boundary" sections and tightened descriptions: `coder` (behavior-changing) vs `refactorer` (behavior-preserving) vs `architecture-implementer` (scaffolding); `code-reviewer` (local, broad) vs `security-reviewer` (OWASP-only) vs `review-pr` (remote GitHub PR); `web-design-guidelines` (general UX) vs `wcag-accessibility` (accessibility only).

### Fixed

- **`coder` skill examples corrected** to practice what they preach: replaced the non-existent PSR-7 `->send()` with a proper SAPI emitter; reworked the transactional use case to depend on a repository interface + transaction boundary instead of injecting raw `PDO` into the application layer; added an explicit authorization check in the controller example; flagged illustrative helper imports; and added a `UNIQUE(email)` note to close the check-then-insert race.
